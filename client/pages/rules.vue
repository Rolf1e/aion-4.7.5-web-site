        <h1 class="title"> General rules </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Insults are punishable if a player reports it to a staff member. Be aware that if you report an insult
                for an insult that is considered "bogus" (such as "idiot" or "noob" except in cases of harassment) you
                will also take the penalty with the person who insulted you. The staff will not try to find out if it
                was a troll or just something said between friends, if you make a report you will take responsibility
                for what you did to that person (of course all reports remain anonymous, the staff is not allowed to
                reveal the identity of the person who reported you).
            </li>

            <li>
                Insults/troll/taunt against staff members are also punishable acts.
            </li>

            <li>
                Impersonating a staff member is also a punishable act.
            </li>

            <li>
                Provoking, insulting, racist, sexist nicknames are not tolerated on the server. Names with a large
                number of the same letter are forbidden, such as: "Nammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmme" or names in capital letters
                "NAME".
            </li>

            <li>
                The player not respecting this will be renamed by a GM without warning. This player will not be able to
                complain about the nickname chosen by the GM because he did not respect the rules. It will then be up to
                him to buy a change of name ticket if he wishes to change his name. If a player repeats the offence by
                giving a nickname that does not comply with the rules, this will be considered as provocation to the
                staff and will be heavily sanctioned.
            </li>

            <li>
                The nickname rule also applies to legion names.
            </li>

            <li>
                We do not authorize the lending of an account, if this is the case you will bear the consequences.
            </li>

            <li>
                It is impossible to discuss a sanction put by a staff member. However, if YOU feel that the penalty is
                unfair YOU should contact an administrator via forum message, only requests via forum message will be
                considered. Of course if we insist on the "you", you must understand that any intervention of persons
                outside the concerned persons will serve no purpose except to make them reap a sanction.

            </li>

        <h1 class="title"> Rules during Events</h1>

        <ul>

            <li>
                It is forbidden to register in the FFA, 1v1 or dredgion arenas during an event.
                If a player does so, he will not be teleported into the event.
            </li>

            <li>
                Send a message only once to the event organizer if he asks you to whisper him to participate in his
                event. A flood of messages will result in you not being caught, and may lead to a mute of your
                character.
            </li>

            <li>
                You are not allowed to fight other players or staff until the event organizer allows you to do so. Any
                attempt to do so will be punished by a kill, to calm you down, and then if you start the event again you
                will be excluded from the event with a withdrawal of tolls on your account.
            </li>

            <li>
                Don't spam chat conversations like the /s or /crier or chat channels during the event. (Each event has
                additional rules that are set by the organizer. Follow them carefully, otherwise you will be expelled
                from the event and face heavier penalties).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Reminder: The general rules also apply to events.</p>
